# Provision Terraform Resources

## Set variables for resources

:::warning
**BREAKING CHANGE**: This is a breaking change of the `v1alpha1` API.
:::

Users who are upgrading from TF-controller <= 0.7.0 require updating `varsFrom`,
from a single object:

```yaml hl_lines="2"
  varsFrom:
    kind: ConfigMap
    name: cluster-config
```

to be an array of object, like this:

```yaml hl_lines="2"
  varsFrom:
  - kind: ConfigMap
    name: cluster-config
```

---

### **vars** and **varsFrom**

You can pass variables to Terraform using the `vars` and `varsFrom` fields.

Inline variables can be set using `vars`. The `varsFrom` field accepts a list of ConfigMaps / Secrets.
You may use the `varsKeys` property of `varsFrom` to select specific keys from the input or omit this field
to select all keys from the input source.

Note that in the case of the same variable key being passed multiple times, the controller will use
the lattermost instance of the key passed to `varsFrom`.

```yaml hl_lines="15-20 22-28"
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: auto
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
  vars:
  - name: region
    value: us-east-1
  - name: env
    value: dev
  - name: instanceType
    value: t3-small
  varsFrom:
  - kind: ConfigMap
    name: cluster-config
    varsKeys:
    - nodeCount
    - instanceType
  - kind: Secret
    name: cluster-creds
```

### Variable value as HCL

The `vars` field supports HCL string, number, bool, object and list types. For example, the following variable can be populated using the accompanying Terraform spec:

```hcl hl_lines="3-6"
variable "cluster_spec" {
  type = object({
      region     = string
      env        = string
      node_count = number
      public     = bool
  })
}
```

```yaml hl_lines="17-20"
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: auto
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
  vars:
  - name: cluster_spec
    value:
      region: us-east-1
      env: dev
      node_count: 10
      public: false
```

## Auto approve resources

To provision resources with TF-controller, you need to create a `Terraform` object and a Flux source object, 
such as a `GitRepository` or `OCIRepository` object.

### Create a Terraform object

The `Terraform` object is a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) object.
It is the core object of TF-controller. 

It defines the Terraform module, the backend configuration, and the GitOps automation mode.

The Terraform module is a Terraform configuration that can be used to provision resources.
It can be placed inside a Git repository, or packaged as an OCI image in an OCI registry.

The backend configuration is the configuration for the Terraform backend to be used to store the Terraform state.
It is optional. If not specified, the Kubernetes backend will be used by default.

### GitOps automation mode

the GitOps automation mode is the GitOps automation mode to be used to run the Terraform module.
It is optional. If not specified, the "plan-and-manually-apply" mode will be used by default.
In this example, we use the "auto-apply" mode.

The following is an example of a `Terraform` object:

```yaml hl_lines="8"
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  path: ./helloworld
  interval: 10m
  approvePlan: auto
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
```

## Manually apply resources

Assume that you have a `GitRepository` object named `helloworld` pointing to a Git repository, and you want to plan and apply the Terraform resources under `./` of that Git repo.

For the plan & manual approval workflow, please start by either setting `.spec.approvePlan` to be the blank value, or omitting the field.

```yaml hl_lines="7"
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: "" # or you can omit this field
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
```

Then after a reconciliation loop, the controller will generate a plan, and tell you how to use field `.spec.approvePlan` to approve the plan.
You can run the following command to obtain that message.

```bash
kubectl -n flux-system get tf/helloworld
```

After making change and push, it will apply the plan to create real resources.

```yaml hl_lines="7"
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: plan-main-b8e362c206 # first 8 digits of a commit hash is enough
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
```

## Destroying resources

The resources provisioned by a Terraform object are not destroyed by default, and the tfstate of that Terraform object still remains in the cluster.

It means that you are safe to delete the Terraform object in the cluster and re-create it. 
If you re-create a new Terraform object with the same name, namespace and workspace, it will continue to use the tfstate inside the cluster as the starting point to reconcile.

However, you may want to destroy provisioned resources when delete the Terraform object in many scenarios.
To enable destroy resources on object deletion, set `.spec.destroyResourcesOnDeletion` to `true`.

~> **WARNING:** This feature will destroy your resources on the cloud if the Terraform object gets deleted. Please use it with cautions.

```yaml hl_lines="8"
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: auto
  destroyResourcesOnDeletion: true
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
```
